Please Note...

Models that have been imported with their embedded material information:

Unreal does not seem to like importing the Metal data.

Also - Unreal plugs the Roughness maps into the metal.

Associated Metal Maps will be in the .fbm folders.

Roughness needs plugging into the correct node and the associated metal map importing and plugging in.


Unless different materials want to be applied of course.

(also - unreal seems to ramp up the metal in comparison to Blender)
